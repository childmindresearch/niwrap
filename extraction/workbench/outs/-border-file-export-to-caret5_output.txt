  "short_description": "EXPORT BORDER FILE TO CARET5 FILE FORMAT",
  "help_text": "A Workbench border file may contain borders for multiple structures and borders that are both projected and unprojected.  It also contains a color table for the borders. \n\nCaret5 has both border (unprojected) and border projection (projected) files.  In addition, each Caret5 border or border projection file typically contains data for a single structure. Caret5 also uses a border color file that associates colors with the names of the borders. \n\nThis command will try to output both Caret5 border and border projection files.  Each output border/border projection file will contains data for one structure so there may be many files created.  The structure name is included in the name of each border or border projection file that is created. \n\nOne Caret5 border color file will also be produced by this command. \n\nProviding surface(s) as input parameters is optional, but recommended. Surfaces may be needed to create both projected and/or unprojected coordinates of borders.  If there is a failure to produce an output border or border projection due to a missing surface with the matching structure, an error message will be displayed and some output files will not be created. \n\nWhen writing new files, this command will overwrite a file with the same name.
