  "description": "N4 is a variant of the popular N3 (nonparameteric nonuniform normalization) retrospective bias correction algorithm. Based on the assumption that the corruption of the low frequency bias field can be modeled as a convolution of the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, the basic algorithmic protocol is to iterate between deconvolving the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, remapping the intensities, and then spatially smoothing this result by a B-spline modeling of the bias field itself.",

Otherwise bias correction occurs over the entire image domain.  See also the option description for the weight image. If a mask image is *not* specified then the entire image region will be used as the mask region. Note that this is different than the N3 implementation which uses the results of Otsu thresholding to define a mask. However, this leads to unknown anatomical regions being included and excluded during the bias correction."
