    Args:
        tracks_in: the input track file(s)
        tracks_out: the output track file
        include: specify an inclusion region of interest, as either a binary
            mask image, or as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values
            (x,y,z,radius). Streamlines must traverse ALL inclusion regions to be
            accepted.
        include_ordered: specify an inclusion region of interest, as either a
            binary mask image, or as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values
            (x,y,z,radius). Streamlines must traverse ALL inclusion_ordered regions
            in the order they are specified in order to be accepted.
        exclude: specify an exclusion region of interest, as either a binary
            mask image, or as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values
            (x,y,z,radius). Streamlines that enter ANY exclude region will be
            discarded.
        mask: specify a masking region of interest, as either a binary mask
            image, or as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values (x,y,z,radius). If
            defined, streamlines exiting the mask will be truncated.
        maxlength: set the maximum length of any streamline in mm
        minlength: set the minimum length of any streamline in mm
        number: set the desired number of selected streamlines to be propagated
            to the output file
        skip: omit this number of selected streamlines before commencing writing
            to the output file
        maxweight: set the maximum weight of any streamline
        minweight: set the minimum weight of any streamline
        inverse: output the inverse selection of streamlines based on the
            criteria provided; i.e. only those streamlines that fail at least one
            selection criterion, and/or vertices that are outside masks if provided,
            will be written to file
        ends_only: only test the ends of each streamline against the provided
            include/exclude ROIs
        tck_weights_in: specify a text scalar file containing the streamline
            weights
        tck_weights_out: specify the path for an output text scalar file
            containing streamline weights
        info: display information messages.
        quiet: do not display information messages or progress status;
            alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET
            environment variable to a non-empty string.
        debug: display debugging messages.
        force: force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as
            input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
        nthreads: use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set
            to 0 to disable multi-threading).
        config: temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
        help_: display this information page and exit.
        version: display version information and exit.
        runner: Command runner
    Returns:
