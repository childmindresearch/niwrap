    Register two images together using a symmetric rigid, affine or non-linear
    transformation model.
    
    By default this application will perform an affine, followed by non-linear
    registration.
    
    FOD registration (with apodised point spread reorientation) will be
    performed by default if the number of volumes in the 4th dimension equals
    the number of coefficients in an antipodally symmetric spherical harmonic
    series (e.g. 6, 15, 28 etc). The -no_reorientation option can be used to
    force reorientation off if required.
    
    Non-linear registration computes warps to map from both image1->image2 and
    image2->image1. Similar to Avants (2008) Med Image Anal. 12(1): 26â€“41,
    registration is performed by matching both the image1 and image2 in a
    'midway space'. Warps can be saved as two deformation fields that map
    directly between image1->image2 and image2->image1, or if using
    -nl_warp_full as a single 5D file that stores all 4 warps
    image1->mid->image2, and image2->mid->image1. The 5D warp format stores
    x,y,z deformations in the 4th dimension, and uses the 5th dimension to index
    the 4 warps. The affine transforms estimated (to midway space) are also
    stored as comments in the image header. The 5D warp file can be used to
    reinitialise subsequent registrations, in addition to transforming images to
    midway space (e.g. for intra-subject alignment in a 2-time-point
    longitudinal analysis).

            and regridded to the midway space. Note that -transformed_midway needs\

        mask1: a mask to define the region of image1 to use for optimisation.

            rotation\

            initialisation (affects 'mass').
        init_translation_unmasked2: disregard mask2 for the translation\
            initialisation (affects 'mass').
        init_rotation_unmasked1: disregard mask1 for the rotation\
            initialisation (affects 'search' and 'moments').
        init_rotation_unmasked2: disregard mask2 for the rotation\
            initialisation (affects 'search' and 'moments').
        init_rotation_search_angles: rotation angles for the local search in\
            degrees between 0 and 180. (Default: 2,5,10,15,20).
        init_rotation_search_scale: relative size of the images used for the\
            rotation search. (Default: 0.15).
        init_rotation_search_directions: number of rotation axis for local\
            search. (Default: 250).
        init_rotation_search_run_global: perform a global search. (Default:\
            local).
        init_rotation_search_global_iterations: number of rotations to\
            investigate (Default: 10000).
        linstage_iterations: number of iterations for each registration stage,\
            not to be confused with -rigid_niter or -affine_niter. This can be used\
            to generate intermediate diagnostics images\
            (-linstage.diagnostics.prefix) or to change the cost function optimiser\
            during registration (without the need to repeatedly resize the images).\
            (Default: 1 == no repetition).
        linstage_optimiser_first: Cost function optimisation algorithm to use\
            at first iteration of all stages. Valid choices: bbgd (Barzilai-Borwein\
            gradient descent) or gd (simple gradient descent). (Default: bbgd).
        linstage_optimiser_last: Cost function optimisation algorithm to use at\
            last iteration of all stages (if there are more than one). Valid\
            choices: bbgd (Barzilai-Borwein gradient descent) or gd (simple\
            gradient descent). (Default: bbgd).
        linstage_optimiser_default: Cost function optimisation algorithm to use\
            at any stage iteration other than first or last iteration. Valid\
            choices: bbgd (Barzilai-Borwein gradient descent) or gd (simple\
            gradient descent). (Default: bbgd).
        linstage_diagnostics_prefix: generate diagnostics images after every\
            registration stage.
        nl_warp: the non-linear warp output defined as two deformation fields,\
            where warp1 can be used to transform image1->image2 and warp2 to\
            transform image2->image1. The deformation fields also encapsulate any\
            linear transformation estimated prior to non-linear registration.
        nl_warp_full: output all warps used during registration. This saves\
            four different warps that map each image to a midway space and their\
            inverses in a single 5D image file. The 4th image dimension indexes the\
            x,y,z component of the deformation vector and the 5th dimension indexes\
            the field in this order: image1->midway, midway->image1,\
            image2->midway, midway->image2. Where image1->midway defines the field\
            that maps image1 onto the midway space using the reverse convention\
            When linear registration is performed first, the estimated linear\
            transform will be included in the comments of the image header, and\
            therefore the entire linear and non-linear transform can be applied (in\
            either direction) using this output warp file with mrtransform.
        nl_init: initialise the non-linear registration with the supplied warp\
            image. The supplied warp must be in the same format as output using the\
            -nl_warp_full option (i.e. have 4 deformation fields with the linear\
            transforms in the image header).
        nl_scale: use a multi-resolution scheme by defining a scale factor for\
            each level using comma separated values (Default: 0.25,0.5,1.0).
        nl_niter: the maximum number of iterations. This can be specified\
            either as a single number for all multi-resolution levels, or a single\
            value for each level. (Default: 50).
        nl_update_smooth: regularise the gradient update field with Gaussian\
            smoothing (standard deviation in voxel units, Default 2.0).
        nl_disp_smooth: regularise the displacement field with Gaussian\
            smoothing (standard deviation in voxel units, Default 1.0).
        nl_grad_step: the gradient step size for non-linear registration\
            (Default: 0.5).
        nl_lmax: explicitly set the lmax to be used per scale factor in\
            non-linear FOD registration. By default FOD registration will use lmax\
            0,2,4 with default scale factors 0.25,0.5,1.0 respectively. Note that\
            no reorientation will be performed with lmax = 0.
        diagnostics_image: write intermediate images for diagnostics purposes.
        directions: the directions used for FOD reorientation using apodised\
            point spread functions (Default: 60 directions).
        noreorientation: turn off FOD reorientation. Reorientation is on by\
            default if the number of volumes in the 4th dimension corresponds to\
            the number of coefficients in an antipodally symmetric spherical\
            harmonic series (i.e. 6, 15, 28, 45, 66 etc).
        mc_weights: relative weight of images used for multi-contrast\
            registration. Default: 1.0 (equal weighting).
        datatype: specify output image data type. Valid choices are: float32,\
            float32le, float32be, float64, float64le, float64be, int64, uint64,\
            int64le, uint64le, int64be, uint64be, int32, uint32, int32le, uint32le,\
            int32be, uint32be, int16, uint16, int16le, uint16le, int16be, uint16be,\
            cfloat32, cfloat32le, cfloat32be, cfloat64, cfloat64le, cfloat64be,\
            int8, uint8, bit.
        info: display information messages.
        quiet: do not display information messages or progress status;\
            alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET\
            environment variable to a non-empty string.
        debug: display debugging messages.
        force: force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as\
            input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
        nthreads: use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications\
            (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
        config: temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
        help_: display this information page and exit.
        version: display version information and exit.
        contrast1_contrast2: optional list of additional input images used as\
            additional contrasts. Can be used multiple times. contrastX and imageX\
            must share the same coordinate system.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `MrregisterOutputs`).
