    augmentation for deep learning.
    
    This command samples patches from a region of a ND image and stores them
    into a data file that can be read easily in other software, for example,
    NumPy. This is useful for generating training data for machine learning
    projects. Multiple "channels" can be sampled.
    
    c3d chan1.nii chan2.nii chan3.nii mask.nii -xp samples.dat 4x4x4 100
    
    This command will sample the three images chan1, chan2, chan3 at foreground
    voxels in the mask. Voxels in the mask foreground region are sampled
    randomly, following a uniform distribution. The value of 100 means that
    every 100-th voxel, on average, is sampled. The radius 4x4x4 means that
    patches of size 9x9x9 will be generated. For each sampled voxel, the sampled
    intensity data is represented as a 3x9x9x9 array in this example.
    
    To read these samples in NumPy use the following code
    
    dims = (9,9,9) # Patch dimensions
    k = 3 # Number of channels
    bps = (4 * k * reduce(mul, dims, 1)) # Bytes per sample
    np = os.path.getsize(fname) // bps # Number of samples
    arr = numpy.memmap(fname,'float32','r',shape=(np,k) + dims)
    
    It is also possible to visualize the extracted samples in ITK-SNAP by
    reading them as a raw image, with dimensions equal to the dimensions of the
    patch, and the z-dimension multiplied by the number of samples.
    
    The command can also be used to extract entire structures. For example, if
    we have a binary segmentation of a lesion of an approximately known size in
    an MRI scan, we can extract a patch of given size centered on this lesion,
    as follows:
    
    c3d mri.nii lesion_seg.nii -centroid-mark 1 -xp single_sample.dat 50x50x20 1

    These commands are used to manipulate the **convert3d** stack. The stack is
    a linear array of images. Every time an image is specified on the command
    line, it is loaded and placed at the end of the stack. Most operations take
    one image from the end of the stack, apply some operation to it, and place
    the result on the end of the stack. Certain commands like **-levelset** and
    **-reslice-matrix** take two images from the end of the stack as the input
    and replace them with a single output. Some other commands, like **-mean**
    and **-vote** take all images on the stack and replace them with a single
    output.
    
    Sometimes, for complex operations, it is useful to change the order of the
    images on the stack, to duplicate images, or to execute the same command
    multiple times. The stack manipulation and flow control commands allow you
    to complete complex tasks without saving intermediate images to the disk.

    Alpha values must be between 0 and 1. Red, green and blue values should be
    on the same order as the intensity of the grey image (typically 0-255). The

    This command takes a grayscale image and a label image (i.e. image with a
    set of discrete values) and produces red, green and blue components of a
    color image. The resulting color image is an overlay of the labels over the
    grey image. The first parameter (*lookup\\_table*) is a text file with
    entries in the format
    
    label_value red green blue alpha
    
    Alpha values must be between 0 and 1. Red, green and blue values should be
    on the same order as the intensity of the grey image (typically 0-255). The
    text file is compatible with ITK-SNAP and can be generated using the
    ITK-SNAP `Segmentation->Save Label Descriptions` command. The second
    parameter (*opacity*) is between 0 and 1 and sets the overall opacity of the
    overlay. The output of this command is similar to the way ITK-SNAP presents
    segmentation data on top of grayscale images.

    Note: this command does not interpolate between entries in the lookup table.
    It should not be used for images with a continuous intensity spectrum.
    
    Here is a more complex example, used to visualize a segmentation result. We
    do a few things in this command: trim grayscale and segmentation images to
    an ROI around the object of interest; map intensity range of the grayscale
    image to 0-255; extract slices through the middle of the cropped images;
    overlay segmentation on the grayscale image; and save as a color PNG file.

    -reorder: Rearrange images on the stack
    
    Syntax: `-reorder k` or `-reorder fraction`
    
    Rearranges images in the stack, such that images that are k positions apart
    become next to each other on the stack. In other words, if the original
    order of the images is 1, 2, ..., n, the new order of the images becomes 1,
    1+k, 1+2k, ..., 2, 2+k, 2+2k, ..., k, 2k, ... n. Of course, n must be
    divisible by k. As an alternative to specifying k, you can specify a
    floating point number (i.e., **-reorder** 0.5), in which case k is obtained
    by multiplying n by the floating point number and rounding to the nearest
    integer.

    -vote-mrf: Vote with Markov Random Field regularlization
    
    Syntax: `-vote-mrf <mode> <lambda>`
    
    This command is similar to **-vote** but it performs regularlization using
    the Markov Random Field (MRF). This form of regularization penalizes the
    total surface area of the segments in the output. It results in more
    contiguous segments.
    
    The command takes all the images on the stack and assumes that they are
    likelihood images corresponding to labels 1, 2, ... N. This means that voxel
    **x** in image **k** holds the probability that voxel **x** has label **k**.
    Likelihood images must be between 0 and 1. Any values outside of the range
    are interpreted as the voxel being excluded from the voting. These voxels
    will be assigned label 0 in the output.
    
    The problem is encoded in the form of energy minimization, consisting of a
    data term and a regularization term. The data term encodes the cost
    (penalty) associated with assigning the voxel **x** the label **k**. The
    parameter **mode** describes how likelihood images are mapped to the cost.
    
    * `VOTES_AGAINST` or `VA`. This mode is useful when the command is being
    used to combine several multi-label segmentations into a single one. Each
    likelihood image is assumed to be the proportion of segmentations that
    assign label *k* to voxel *x*. The data term equals to the error associated
    to assining the voxel *k* label *x*. This error is calculated as the sum of
    the likelihoods for all labels at *x* minus the likelihood for *k* at *x*.
    Note that the likelihoods do not have to add up to one, which may be
    interpreted as missing data for some voxels.
    
    * `LOG_LIKELIHOOD` or `LL`. The cost for label *k* at voxel *x* is the
    logarithm of the k-th likelihood image at *x*. This will assign infinite
    cost when the likelihood is zero.
    
    The regularlization term is encoded as **lambda** times the total number of
    neighboring voxels inside the mask (non-excluded region of the image) that
    have different labels.
