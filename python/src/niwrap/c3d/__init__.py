Convert3D

Convert3D (unix name c3d) is a command-line image processing tool that offers
complementary features to ITK-SNAP. Originally developed to convert between
various 3D image formats, the tool has become more of a Swiss army knife for
medical image processing. In addition to many standard filters and resampling
commands, c3d offers tools specialized for multilabel images (such as
segmentation images output by ITK-SNAP) and multicomponent images (such as RGB
images read by SNAP). Through the use of reverse polish notation on the command
line, c3d allows many image processing tasks to be combined in small
command-line mini-programs. This saves on the need to save intermediate image
files, saving disk space and network bandwidth. We use c3d extensively to run
studies with thousands of 3D images, and are continually adding commands and
features to the tool.
