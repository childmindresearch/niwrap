    Report length of borders.
    
    For each border, print its length along the surface, in mm. If a border has
    multiple parts, their lengths are summed before printing, unless
    -separate-pieces is specified.
    
    The -corrected-areas option is intended for when the length is not
    meaningfully measurable on individual surfaces, it is only an approximate
    correction for the reduction in structure of a group average surface.
