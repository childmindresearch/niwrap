    Compute signed distance from one surface to another.
    
    Compute the signed distance function of the reference surface at every
    vertex on the comparison surface. NOTE: this relation is NOT symmetric, the
    line from a vertex to the closest point on the 'ref' surface (the one that
    defines the signed distance function) will only align with the normal of the
    'ref' surface. Valid specifiers for winding methods are as follows:
    
    EVEN_ODD (default)
    NEGATIVE
    NONZERO
    NORMALS
    
    The NORMALS method uses the normals of triangles and edges, or the closest
    triangle hit by a ray from the point. This method may be slightly faster,
    but is only reliable for a closed surface that does not cross through
    itself. All other methods count entry (positive) and exit (negative)
    crossings of a vertical ray from the point, then counts as inside if the
    total is odd, negative, or nonzero, respectively.
