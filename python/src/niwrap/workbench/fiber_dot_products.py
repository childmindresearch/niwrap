    Compute dot products of fiber orientations with surface normals.
    
    For each vertex, this command finds the closest fiber population that
    satisfies the <direction> test, and computes the absolute value of the dot
    product of the surface normal and the normalized mean direction of each
    fiber. The <direction> test must be one of INSIDE, OUTSIDE, or ANY, which
    causes the command to only use fiber populations that are inside the
    surface, outside the surface, or to not care which direction it is from the
    surface. Each fiber population is output in a separate metric column.

            population may be, in mm.
        direction: test against surface for whether a fiber population should\

        dot_metric: the metric of dot products.
        f_metric: a metric of the f values of the fiber distributions.
