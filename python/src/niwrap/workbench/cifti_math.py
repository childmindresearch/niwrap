    Evaluate expression on cifti files.
    
    This command evaluates <expression> at each matrix element independently.
    There must be at least one -var option (to get the output layout from), even
    if the <name> specified in it isn't used in <expression>.
    
    To select a single column from a 2D file (most cifti files are 2D), use
    -select 1 <index>, where <index> is 1-based. To select a single row from a
    2D file, use -select 2 <index>. Where -select is not used, the cifti files
    must have compatible mappings (e.g., brain models and parcels mappings must
    match exactly except for parcel names). Use -override-mapping-check to skip
    this checking.
    
    Filenames are not valid in <expression>, use a variable name and a -var
    option with matching <name> to specify an input file. The format of
    <expression> is as follows:
    
    Expressions consist of constants, variables, operators, parentheses, and
    functions, in infix notation, such as 'exp(-x + 3) * scale'. Variables are
    strings of any length, using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but may
    not take the name of a named constant. Currently, there is only one named
    constant, PI. The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, !, &&,
    ||. These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation, i.e. pow(x, y),
    and takes higher precedence than other binary operators (also, '-3^-4^-5'
    means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))'). The <=, >=, ==, and != operators are given a small
    amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth of the smaller of the absolute
    values of the values being compared.
    
    Comparison and logical operators return 0 or 1, you can do masking with
    expressions like 'x * (mask > 0)'. For all logical operators, an input is
    considered true iff it is greater than 0. The expression '0 < x < 5' is not
    syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because it is
    evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 < x) < 5)', which will always return 1,
    as both possible results of a comparison are less than 5. A warning is
    generated if an expression of this type is detected. Use something like 'x >
    0 && x < 5' to get the desired behavior.
    
    Whitespace between elements is ignored, ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent to
    'sin(2*x)', but 's in(2*x)' is an error. Implied multiplication is not
    allowed, the expression '2x' will be parsed as a variable. Parentheses are
    (), do not use [] or {}. Functions require parentheses, the expression 'sin
    x' is an error.
    
    The following functions are supported:
    
    sin: 1 argument, the sine of the argument (units are radians)
    cos: 1 argument, the cosine of the argument (units are radians)
    tan: 1 argument, the tangent of the argument (units are radians)
    asin: 1 argument, the inverse of sine of the argument, in radians
    acos: 1 argument, the inverse of cosine of the argument, in radians
    atan: 1 argument, the inverse of tangent of the argument, in radians
    atan2: 2 arguments, atan2(y, x) returns the inverse of tangent of (y/x), in
    radians, determining quadrant by the sign of both arguments
    sinh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic sine of the argument
    cosh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic cosine of the argument
    tanh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic tangent of the argument
    asinh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic sine of the argument
    acosh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the argument
    atanh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the argument
    sinc: 1 argument, sinc(0) = 1, sin(x) / x otherwise
    ln: 1 argument, the natural logarithm of the argument
    exp: 1 argument, the constant e raised to the power of the argument
    log: 1 argument, the base 10 logarithm of the argument
    log2: 1 argument, the base 2 logarithm of the argument
    sqrt: 1 argument, the square root of the argument
    abs: 1 argument, the absolute value of the argument
    floor: 1 argument, the largest integer not greater than the argument
    round: 1 argument, the nearest integer, with ties rounded away from zero
    ceil: 1 argument, the smallest integer not less than the argument
    min: 2 arguments, min(x, y) returns y if (x > y), x otherwise
    max: 2 arguments, max(x, y) returns y if (x < y), x otherwise
    mod: 2 arguments, mod(x, y) = x - y * floor(x / y), or 0 if y == 0
    clamp: 3 arguments, clamp(x, low, high) = min(max(x, low), high)
    .
