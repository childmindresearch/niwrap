    Update scene file.
    
    This command will update a scene for specific changes in data files.
    
    "-fix-map-palette-settings" will find all data files that have had a change
    in the number of maps since the scene scene was created. If the file has its
    "Apply to All Maps" property enabled, the palette setting in the first map
    is copied to all maps in the file. Note: This modifies the palette settings
    for the file in the scene (data file is NOT modified).
    
    "-copy-map-one-palette" will copy the palette settings from the first map to
    all other maps in a data file. This option is typically used when the number
    of maps in a data file changes. It changes the palette settings in the scene
    that are applied to the data file when the scene is loaded (the data file is
    not modified). The name of the data file specified on the command line is
    matched to the end of file names in the scene. This allows matching multiple
    files if their names end with the same characters. It also allows including
    a relative path when there is more than one file with the same name but in
    different paths and only one of the files to be updated.
    
    "-remove-missing-files" Any files that fail to load when the scene is read
    will be removed from the scene. Thus, if one deletes files prior to running
    with this option, the deleted files are removed from the scene.
    
    "-error" If this option is provided and there is an error while performing
    any of the scene operations, the command will immediately cease processing
    and the output scene file will not be created. Otherwise any errors will be
    listed after the command finishes.
