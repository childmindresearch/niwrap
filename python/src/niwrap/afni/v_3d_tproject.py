    This program projects (detrends) out various 'nuisance' time series from each
    voxel in the input dataset. Note that all the projections are done via linear
    regression, including the frequency-based options such as '-passband'. In this
    way, you can bandpass time-censored data, and at the same time, remove other
    time series of no interest (e.g., physiological estimates, motion parameters).

    URL: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/
    
    Args:
        in_file: Input file to 3dtproject.
        tr: Use time step dd for the frequency calculations,rather than the\
            value stored in the dataset header.
        automask: Generate a mask automatically.
        bandpass: (a float, a float). Remove all frequencies except those in\
            the range.
        blur: Blur (inside the mask only) with a filter that haswidth (fwhm) of\
            fff millimeters.spatial blurring (if done) is after the timeseries\
            filtering.
        cenmode: 'kill' or 'zero' or 'ntrp'. Specifies how censored time points\
            are treated in the output dataset:* mode = zero -- put zero values in\
            their place; output dataset is same length as input* mode = kill --\
            remove those time points; output dataset is shorter than input* mode =\
            ntrp -- censored values are replaced by interpolated neighboring (in\
            time) non-censored values, before any projections, and then the\
            analysis proceeds without actual removal of any time points -- this\
            feature is to keep the spanish inquisition happy.* the default mode is\
            kill !!!.
        censor: Filename of censor .1d time series.this is a file of 1s and 0s,\
            indicating whichtime points are to be included (1) and which areto be\
            excluded (0).
        censortr: List of strings that specify time indexes to be removed from\
            the analysis. each string isof one of the following forms:* ``37`` =>\
            remove global time index #37* ``2:37`` => remove time index #37 in run\
            #2* ``37..47`` => remove global time indexes #37-47* ``37-47`` => same\
            as above* ``2:37..47`` => remove time indexes #37-47 in run #2*\
            ``*:0-2`` => remove time indexes #0-2 in all runs * time indexes within\
            each run start at 0. * run indexes start at 1 (just be to confusing). *\
            n.b.: 2:37,47 means index #37 in run #2 and global time index 47; it\
            does not mean index #37 in run #2 and index #47 in run #2.
        concat: The catenation file, as in 3ddeconvolve, containing thetr\
            indexes of the start points for each contiguous runwithin the input\
            dataset (the first entry should be 0).* also as in 3ddeconvolve, if the\
            input dataset is automatically catenated from a collection of datasets,\
            then the run start indexes are determined directly, and '-concat' is\
            not needed (and will be ignored).* each run must have at least 9 time\
            points after censoring, or the program will not work!* the only use\
            made of this input is in setting up the bandpass/stopband regressors.*\
            '-ort' and '-dsort' regressors run through all time points, as read in.\
            if you want separate projections in each run, then you must either\
            break these ort files into appropriate components, or you must run\
            3dtproject for each run separately, using the appropriate pieces from\
            the ort files via the ``{...}`` selector for the 1d files and the\
            ``[...]`` selector for the datasets.
        dsort: Remove the 3d+time time series in dataset fset.* that is, 'fset'\
            contains a different nuisance time series for each voxel (e.g., from\
            anaticor).* multiple -dsort options are allowed.
        mask: Only operate on voxels nonzero in the mset dataset.* voxels\
            outside the mask will be filled with zeros.* if no masking option is\
            given, then all voxels will be processed.
        noblock: Also as in 3ddeconvolve, if you want the program to treatan\
            auto-catenated dataset as one long run, use this option.however,\
            '-noblock' will not affect catenation if you usethe '-concat' option.
        norm: normalize each output time series to have sum ofsquares = 1. this\
            is the last operation.
        ort: Remove each column in file.each column will have its mean removed.
        polort: Remove polynomials up to and including degree pp.* default\
            value is 2.* it makes no sense to use a value of pp greater than 2, if\
            you are bandpassing out the lower frequencies!* for catenated datasets,\
            each run gets a separate set set of pp+1 legendre polynomial\
            regressors.* use of -polort -1 is not advised (if data mean != 0), even\
            if -ort contains constant terms, as all means are removed.
        stopband: (a float, a float). Remove all frequencies in the range.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `V3dTprojectOutputs`).
