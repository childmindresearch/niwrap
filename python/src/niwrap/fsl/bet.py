    Automated brain extraction tool for FSL.
    
    Author: FMRIB Analysis Group, University of Oxford
    
    URL: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki
    
    Args:
        infile: Input image (e.g. img.nii.gz).
        maskfile: Output brain mask (e.g. img_bet.nii.gz).
        fractional_intensity: Fractional intensity threshold (0->1);\
            default=0.5; smaller values give larger brain outline estimates.
        vg_fractional_intensity: Vertical gradient in fractional intensity\
            threshold (-1->1); default=0; positive values give larger brain outline\
            at bottom, smaller at top.
        center_of_gravity: The xyz coordinates of the center of gravity\
            (voxels, not mm) of initial mesh surface. Must have exactly three\
            numerical entries in the list (3-vector).
        overlay: Generate brain surface outline overlaid onto original image.
        binary_mask: Generate binary brain mask.
        approx_skull: Generate rough skull image (not as clean as betsurf).
        no_seg_output: Don't generate segmented brain image output.
        vtk_mesh: Generate brain surface as mesh in .vtk format.
        head_radius: head radius (mm not voxels); initial surface sphere is set\
            to half of this.
        thresholding: Apply thresholding to segmented brain image and mask.
        robust_iters: More robust brain center estimation, by iterating BET\
            with a changing center-of-gravity.
        residual_optic_cleanup: This attempts to cleanup residual eye and optic\
            nerve voxels which bet2 can sometimes leave behind. This can be useful\
            when running SIENA or SIENAX, for example. Various stages involving\
            standard-space masking, morphpological operations and thresholdings are\
            combined to produce a result which can often give better results than\
            just running bet2.
        reduce_bias: This attempts to reduce image bias, and residual neck\
            voxels. This can be useful when running SIENA or SIENAX, for example.\
            Various stages involving FAST segmentation-based bias field removal and\
            standard-space masking are combined to produce a result which can often\
            give better results than just running bet2.
        slice_padding: This can improve the brain extraction if only a few\
            slices are present in the data (i.e., a small field of view in the Z\
            direction). This is achieved by padding the end slices in both\
            directions, copying the end slices several times, running bet2 and then\
            removing the added slices.
        whole_set_mask: This option uses bet2 to determine a brain mask on the\
            basis of the first volume in a 4D data set, and applies this to the\
            whole data set. This is principally intended for use on FMRI data, for\
            example to remove eyeballs. Because it is normally important (in this\
            application) that masking be liberal (ie that there be little risk of\
            cutting out valid brain voxels) the -f threshold is reduced to 0.3, and\
            also the brain mask is "dilated" slightly before being used.
        additional_surfaces: This runs both bet2 and betsurf programs in order\
            to get the additional skull and scalp surfaces created by betsurf. This\
            involves registering to standard space in order to allow betsurf to\
            find the standard space masks it needs.
        additional_surfaces_t2: This is the same as -A except that a T2 image\
            is also input, to further improve the estimated skull and scalp\
            surfaces. As well as carrying out the standard space registration this\
            also registers the T2 to the T1 input image.
        verbose: Switch on diagnostic messages.
        debug: Don't delete temporary intermediate images.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `BetOutputs`).
