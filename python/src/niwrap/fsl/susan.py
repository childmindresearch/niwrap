    Args:
        input_file: Input image file.
        brightness_threshold: Brightness threshold; should be greater than\
            noise level and less than contrast of edges to be preserved.
        spatial_size: Spatial size (sigma, i.e., half-width) of smoothing, in\
            mm.
        dimensionality: Dimensionality (2 or 3), for within-plane (2) or fully\
            3D (3) smoothing.
        use_median_filter: Use median filter for cases where single-point noise\
            is detected (0 or 1).
        n_usans: Determine if the smoothing area is found from secondary images\
            (0, 1 or 2).
        output_file: Output image file.
        usan1: First USAN image file.
        brightness_threshold1: Brightness threshold for first USAN image.
        usan2: Second USAN image file.
        brightness_threshold2: Brightness threshold for second USAN image.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `SusanOutputs`).
