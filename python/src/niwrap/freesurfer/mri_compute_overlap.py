    Computes three different types of overlap measures for labels in input volumes.
    
    Author: FreeSurfer Developers
    
    URL: https://github.com/freesurfer/freesurfer
    
    Args:
        volumes: Input volume files for which overlap measures are computed.
        label_numbers: List of specific label numbers for which to compute\
            overlap measures. If not specified, all labels are considered if -a is\
            provided.
        all_labels: Compute overlap for all labels.
        show_label: Show label name for segmentation.
        total_overlap: Compute the total overlap, which is the number of voxels\
            that are the same among all labels.
        no_summary: Do not compute total label summary.
        mask: Limit the domain of the calculation to the nonzero voxels in\
            specified volume.
        output_file: Filename to write results to.
        quiet_mode: Do not display results on standard display. If -l is\
            specified, this flag is automatically set.
        translate_label: Translate label l1 to label l2.
        help_: Print help.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `MriComputeOverlapOutputs`).
