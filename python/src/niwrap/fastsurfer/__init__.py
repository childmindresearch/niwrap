FastSurfer

FastSurfer is a fast and accurate deep-learning based neuroimaging pipeline. It
provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (FastSurferVINN)
and surface-based thickness analysis (recon-surf). The deep learning models were
trained on 60+ manually annotated brain scans and provide state-of-the-art
accuracy. FastSurfer can segment a full brain scan in less than 1 minute, is
robust against changes in input scanner contrasts, and generalizes well to
non-training data.

FastSurfer includes three main components:
1. FastSurferVINN - A deep learning architecture for whole brain segmentation
2. CerebNet - For detailed cerebellum sub-segmentation
3. HypVINN - For hypothalamus sub-segmentation

The pipeline produces FreeSurfer-compatible outputs and can be used as a drop-in
replacement for FreeSurfer's recon-all pipeline, while being orders of magnitude
faster.
