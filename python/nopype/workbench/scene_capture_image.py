    OFFSCREEN RENDERING OF SCENE TO AN IMAGE FILE.
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Render content of browser windows displayed in a scene into image file(s).
    
    If none of the "-size" options are specified, the default is "-size-window"
    (Output image is size of the window that was saved in the scene).
    
    For the "-size" options that accept a width and/or height, the values
    default to number of pixels. To express the width and/or height in physical
    units (inches, centimeters, etc.), use the "-units" option. When physical
    units are used, the pixel width and height are derived using the physical
    width/height and the image resolution (see the "-resolution" option).
    
    Note that scenes created prior to version 1.2 (May 2016) do not contain
    information about the size of the window. Therefore, one must use the
    "-size-width-height" option.
    
    Examples:
    
    Generate an image of the second scene. Width and height of image is width
    and height of window saved in the scene.
    wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg
    
    Generate an image of the second scene with a margin around sides of the
    image. Width and height of image is width and height of window saved in the
    scene.
    wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg -margin 10
    
    Generate an image of the second scene that is 6 inches width with 300 pixels
    per inch. The resulting width is 1800 pixels. The resulting height of the
    image is a function of the width and the aspect ratio (height divided by
    width) of the window size saved in the scene.
    wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image21.jpg \
    -size-width 6 -units INCHES -resolution 300 PIXELS_PER_INCH
    
    Print information about the size of the output image for the second scene
    (no image file is created) using a width of 4.5 centimeters.
    wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 test.jpg \
    -size-width 4.5 -units CENTIMETERS -print-image-info
